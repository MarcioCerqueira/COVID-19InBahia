### Overview

In this repository, we provide the Jupyter Notebook ```data_analysis.ipynb``` that we used to reproduce all the data (Tables and Figures) available in our [PLoS ONE 2020 paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243966). Moreover, we provide both English (```hospitalized_patients_covid_19_bahia_Jun292020-EN.csv```) and Brazilian Portuguese (```hospitalized_patients_covid_19_bahia_Jun292020-PT-BR.csv```) versions of the anonymized dataset of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Bahia, Brazil, as shared by the Health Secretary of the State of Bahia. Please note that the current version of the Jupyter Notebook supports only the processing of the English version of the anonymized dataset.

More details about the structure of the datasets, as well as and our main findings in this study, are available in the [accepted paper.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243966)
